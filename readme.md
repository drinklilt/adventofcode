# Learning Dart with Advent of Code

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Dart programming language through the Advent of Code challenges.  
It also gives you a chance to look at my sloppy code :p

**Why Dart?**  
Because I want to improve my skills at developing mobile apps in flutter, and this is a way to do it, I guess.

**Repository Structure**
- Each day's challenge will have its own folder, containing the Dart solution file and any necessary input files.
- The solutions will be organized by year and day.


> Happy coding! - Lilith
